To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

This RC does not introduce any major user-facing features. It adds more customizability for custom SCSS variables (fixing a bug with callout introduction order), lunr indexing, and loading mermaid locally.

    "content": "We’re back! . Hi all! The Just the Docs team is excited to have our first pre-release in over two years! It is jam-packed with features and bugfixes that have been requested by the community since 2020. They include: . | The new callouts component | Allowing pages and collections to coexist on the navigation pane | New styling: dark syntax highlighting, support for jekyll-asciidoc, word-wrapping instead of overflow for various elements | More customization: external nav links, custom nav footers, favicon includes, search color and placeholder configuration, mermaid.js support, and nav sorting | Over 20 bugfixes! Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out? Please open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Trying out pre-release v0.4.0.rc1 . Due to the massive scope of these changes, we’re making v0.4.0.rc1 available as a release candidate for the theme (i.e., a pre-release) with release v0.4.0 coming soon. We want your help in testing the changes! As of now, the gem on RubyGems and the repository are updated to v0.4.0.rc1. To use this RC explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0.rc1 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0.rc1\" . Staying on v0.3.3 . If you’re not ready to make the switch, that’s alright! If your version of just-the-docs is pinned to v0.3.3 (i.e. by a Gemfile.lock or in remote_theme, then there’s nothing you need to do. If you have not pinned your theme version, you should either: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Use of branches for closed PRs (e.g., #466, #578) is now deprecated, as those branches have been (directly or indirectly) merged, and they may be deleted after the pre-release of v0.4.0.rc1. Maintenance . Internally, our maintainer team has expanded: Patrick Marsceill, the original maintainer, has stepped down from an active role after almost 4 years! We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop. These include: . | upgrading to Jekyll 4, and stopping support for Jekyll 3 | versioned docs - issue #728 | improved accessibility - issues #566, #870 | internationalization (i18n) - issue #59 | recursive/multi-level navigation - PR #462 | toggleable dark mode - issue #234 | . as well as DX improvements like better regression tests, CI, and tooling. If you’re interested in any of these, please join us on GitHub - any contribution (raising an issue, writing docs, or submitting a PR) is welcome! .

This document contains instructions on how to migrate and upgrade Just the Docs sites from every minor or major version bump, starting from v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. | v0.9.x - v0.10.0 | v0.8.x - v0.9.0 | v0.7.x - v0.8.0 | v0.6.x - v0.7.0 . | POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.7.0 . | Moved Include | New Script IDs | . | . | v0.5.x - v0.6.0 . | POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.6.0 . | New Includes | Removed #main-content-wrap | New $color-scheme variable | Cached favicon | . | . | v0.4.x - v0.5.0 . | POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.5.0 | . | v0.3.3 … v0.4.x . | REPOSITORY CHANGES . | Just the Docs | Deploy previews | Just the Docs Template | Just the Docs Tests | . | POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.4.0 . | New includes and SCSS | favicons | Custom callout colors | Pages and collections | Relative URLs | Navigation order | . | DEPRECATIONS . | Jekyll 3 | Footer content configuration | . | THEME WEBSITE CHANGES . | Home page | CHANGELOG | . | NON-BREAKING CHANGES (OUTLINE ONLY) . | Accessibility | Configuration | Customization | Custom Includes | Modular Components | Navigation | Search | Styling | . | . | . If your configuration states remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs, your website is built using the current main branch of the theme, which may include changes made after the latest release; see the CHANGELOG. If your configuration states theme: just_the_docs and your Gemfile specifies gem \"just-the-docs\", your website is always built using the latest release. If you have cloned/forked and customised the theme repo, and pull the changes of a new release to your clone, you may need to resolve merge conflicts. ",

Users who have overridden this _includes should: . | copy in the new upstream _includes/components/nav.html into their site | port over any changes from their custom _includes/nav.html | .

New Includes . Version v0.6.0 introduces three new _includes files: . | _includes/favicon.html, which now contains logic previously in _includes/head.html: loading favicon.ico if no favicon is specified | _includes/head_nav.html, which generates CSS used for the new efficient navigation implementation | _includes/css/activation.scss.liquid, which is used by head_nav for navigation implementation | . If users have existing _includes files with this name, they should be renamed (and imported with their new name) prior to upgrading to 0.6.0. No other change is necessary. Removed #main-content-wrap . In _layouts/default.html and _layouts/minimal.html, the id=\"main-content-wrap\" has been removed from the wrapper div (in part due to a bug with multiple ids on one element). Internally, our theme does not use these ids; for most users, this does not require any action. However, code that relies on this id must be changed. Each of the related elements still has the unique class .main-content-wrap, and can be selected with this class. For example, in CSS: . /* OLD */ #main-content-wrap { /* ... */ } /* NEW */ .main-content-wrap { /* ... */ } . Or in JS: . // OLD document.getElementById(\"main-content-wrap\"); // NEW document.getElementsByClassName(\"main-content-wrap\")[0]; . New $color-scheme variable . The theme now properly sets the color-scheme property. To do so, the new $color-scheme SCSS variable has been created. The variable has been added to the default light scheme, which is always loaded by Just the Docs. Migration is only needed if: . | the packaged light scheme has been overridden (this is not the same as using a custom scheme) | or, the scheme logic to always load light has been changed | . (neither of these behaviours are recommended by Just the Docs) . In either of these cases, users should add a $color-scheme SCSS variable to their active scheme with the appropriate value (see: MDN docs on color-scheme). $color-scheme: light !default; . Cached favicon . Version v0.6.0 adds a new _include that caches the favicon for the entire site. This significantly improves page build times for large sites. However, some users may load different favicons for each page (and/or dynamically change the first favicon load). In this case, they should override the logic in _includes/favicon.html by replacing it with an empty file (this is different from deleting it). No further migration is necessary. ",

    "content": "REPOSITORY CHANGES . Just the Docs . The theme repo is now at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs. The name of its default branch is now main. The theme docs website is now published at https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs. We’ve also retroactively published the theme docs website for version v0.3.3 at https://v0-3-3-docs.just-the-docs.com/. GitHub provides access to previous versions of the theme repo. You can browse previous versions of the theme docs website on the Internet Archive. The README page on the theme repo repeats much of the information from the home page, formatted for browsing on GitHub. It also explains how to install the theme as a Ruby Gem, without creating a new site. Deploy previews . When a PR builds successfully, Netlify provides a preview of how the theme docs website will look if the PR is merged. You can find links to the preview near the bottom of the Conversation tab of the PR. Just the Docs Template . The template at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template creates a repo with the minimal source files for a Just the Docs website. After configuring the relevant parameters, you can build and serve the website both locally and on GitHub Pages – using either Jekyll 3 or Jekyll 4! . Just the Docs Tests . The tests website at https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs-tests consists mainly of regression tests for bug fixes and new features. The test source files at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-tests illustrate the use of many Markdown and Jekyll features, including some that are not included in the theme docs. For example, see how to add support for rendering TeX/LaTeX math formulas with KaTeX and MathJax. POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.4.0 . If switching to a new release of the theme breaks your website, check that you don’t have any files in the _includes, _layouts, and _sass directories with the same names as files provided by the theme. If your repo has a customised copy of _layouts/default.html from a previous release, try removing it, or replace it by a fresh copy of the theme file. The following changes made in v0.4.0 might break or adversely affect your website when you next rebuild it, unless you have pinned it! . New includes and SCSS . Version 0.4.0 introduces many new _includes files. If you already have an existing include with the same name as a new addition, you will need to migrate or update that include. The new files are (relative to the _includes folder): . | mermaid_config.js | nav_footer_custom | search_placeholder_custom | toc_heading_custom | the entire components/ folder: . | aux_nav, breadcrumbs, children_nav, footer, header, mermaid, search_footer, search_header, sidebar | . | the entire icons/ folder . | code_copy, document, expand, external_link, icons, link, menu, search | . | the entire lunr/ folder . | custom-data.json, custom-index.js | . | . We have removed some code in _sass/vendor and added a new file at _sass/custom/setup.scss. favicons . The file _includes/favicon.html is now ignored by the theme. If you’re using it, your website’s favicon is no longer displayed by browsers. To fix: Move the content of _includes/favicon.html to _includes/head_custom.html. Custom callout colors . The file _sass/custom/custom.scss is now imported last: after the configuration of callouts. If you’ve defined custom color variables for callouts in _sass/custom/custom.scss (and used them when configuring your callouts in _config.yml) you will not be able to rebuild your website. To fix: Move custom color variables for callouts in _sass/custom/custom.scss to _sass/custom/variables.scss. Pages and collections . Links to ordinary pages now appear in the navigation on sites that use collections. You might want the navigation of your site to consist entirely of collections. To fix: Add the front matter nav_exclude: true to pages that the navigation should not display. Relative URLs . All generated URLs are now relative. This is a bug fix, and unlikely to break any site. Relative links to pages within a website support deployment to different servers. Navigation order . The order in which the navigation panel lists pages has been simplified. All pages with nav_order values now come before all pages that are ordered by title. If your website has a group of sibling pages where some siblings have nav_order string values, and others are ordered by numerical title values, the former now come before the latter. To fix: Add numerical nav_order values to the pages with numerical title values. DEPRECATIONS . The following features are deprecated, and to be removed in a future release. Jekyll 3 . You can still use Jekyll 3 (3.8.5 or later) to build websites using v0.4.0 of the theme. However, future releases of the theme may require the use of Jekyll 4. You can already use Jekyll 4 to build your website locally. It should look exactly the same as when built with Jekyll 3.1 . To use Jekyll 4 when building your website on GitHub Pages, you need to run GitHub Actions. The simplest way of setting that up in a new repo is to create the repo using the Just the Docs template. To start running Jekyll 4 to build an existing repo on GitHub Pages, you can create a new repo with the template, then copy its .github/workflows directory, and update your repo settings to use Actions. Footer content configuration . Currently, if your configuration sets footer_content to some text, the theme displays that text at the bottom of the main section of each page. The file _includes/footer_custom.html provides a more general way of customizing not only the text but also the markup for the page footer area. You can replicate the current display of TEXT in the footer using the following markup: . &lt;p class=\"text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0\"&gt;TEXT&lt;/p&gt; . THEME WEBSITE CHANGES . The website now uses callouts2 to draw attention to important information. The theme uses semantic versioning. A normal version number takes the form X.Y.Z, where X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. The theme uses version X.Y.Z.rcN for pre-release N of version X.Y.Z. When referring to version numbers on GitHub, we usually prefix them by ‘v’. Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, where anything may change at any time. In practice, we increment the patch version Z for bug fixes and backwards compatible changes; we increment the minor version Y for changes that could break websites using the theme without pinning it to a specific version. The label NEW in the theme website indicates a feature that has been changed or added since the release of the previous minor version. For example, after the release of v0.4.Z, the theme website should label NEW all features that we have changed or added since v0.3.0 – not just since v0.3.3. When we release v0.5.0, we will remove all those labels, and add labels on features since v0.4.0. The theme docs website is not itself versioned. It changes incrementally, independently of theme releases. Home page . The theme home page now focuses on the simplest ways of using the theme. It also notes the different behaviour of theme and remote_theme in connection with interim versions of the theme, such as pre-releases. CHANGELOG . The CHANGELOG page lists the changes made in all previous releases and pre-releases of new versions of the theme gem. It also lists changes made to the main branch of the theme since the latest release or pre-release. For changes since v0.3.3, the log usually references the merged PR that made the change and its author. NON-BREAKING CHANGES (OUTLINE ONLY) . Accessibility . | Skip to main content: the first keyboard-navigatable item is now a link to skip over the sidebar and header to the main content of the page. PR: #949. | Aria-labels: improved aria-labels have been added to various site elements. PRs: #950, … | Other general improvements: gradual changes have improved tab focusability, contrast, and semantic elements. More work still to come. PRs: #498, #846 | . Configuration . | Mermaid support: first-class support for Mermaid - a JavaScript-based diagram and charting tool supported by GitHub - has been added to the theme. This feature is opt-in. See the new doc subsections in Configuration and Code for more. | Multiple Google Analytics tags are now supported. PR: #1029 | . Customization . | all user-facing text is now customizable; previously, several elements (ex search placeholder) were hardwired into the theme. Now, users can blend custom includes and layouts to internationalize their sites. | we’ve clarified the role of custom.scss to be imported last; to allow users to define custom or override variables, we’ve added a new file setup.scss. PR: #1135 | . Custom Includes . We’ve added several custom _includes to provide users with more customization options for different site elements. We’ve also added a section to Configuration to outline these. All of these are opt-in by default; however, these may be breaking if you have existing _includes with the same name. Each item is listed with the relevant file and PR. | TOC heading: toc_heading_custom.html, PR: #980 | Navigation panel footer: nav_footer_custom.html, PR: #474 | Search placeholder: search_placeholder_custom.html, PR: #613 | Modular site components: components/ and icons/, PR: [#1058] | Custom search indices: lunr/, PR: #1068 | . In a future (version 1) release, we may rename the custom include files. Modular Components . We’ve broken up the default layout (_layouts/default.html) into multiple reusable components. This should have no impact on most users; however, it should make it easier to implement custom layouts. For more, see Custom layouts and includes. PR: [#1058]. Navigation . | Collections: nav panel shows links to ordinary pages before collections | Collection folding; part of “Combination”. PR: #578 | Scrolling to show link to selected page. PR: #639 | External nav links are now supported. PR: #876 | Child nav order: sort navigation pages with child_nav_order. PR: #726 | Order when mixing different ways of specifying nav order | . Search . In addition to customizing the search placeholder, we’ve also added the ability to provide custom content to the search index. See Custom content for search index. PR: #1068. Styling . | Code copying: code blocks now allow users to easily copy their contents. PR: #945 | Blockquote: shows vertical bar on left. PR: #965 | Links wrap.

PR: #466 | . | Jekyll 4 depends on more recent versions of other gems than Jekyll 3, and the differences between those versions may affect the files of your built site. &#8617; . | The theme website configuration defines the callout titles and colors used there.
